This project is a beginner friendly implementation of Linear Regression using only NumPy.
Main goal is to understand how regression works mathematically without relying on libraries  like scikit-learn.

# Features-
- Implements from scratch
- Uses Gradient Descent optimization
- Calculates Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)

 # Concept-
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a dependent variable (y) based on independent variable (x).
Hypothesis function
Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)
Gradient Descent Update Rules
